# Color by Number
Welcome to a simple Color by Number web application, developed using HTML, CSS & JavaScript. 

# Inspiration
The inspiration for this project comes from a color by number game on my phone, "UNICORN". The application's design take cues from this mobile game. The pictures used in this application are inspired by those found in the UNICORN app. You can explore the UNICORN app [here on Apple Store](https://apps.apple.com/no/app/unicorn-fargelegging-spill/id1293646758?l=nb).

# Current Features
-   **Single Coloring Picture.** Currently, the application features one coloring picture named "Rainbow".

# Future Plans
The goal is to expand the library of images available for coloring
