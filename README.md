# Color by Number
ðŸŽ¨ Welcome to a simple Color by Number web application, developed using HTML, CSS & JavaScript. 

The inspiration for this project comes from a color by number game on my phone, "UNICORN". The application's design take cues from this mobile game. The pictures used in this application are inspired by those found in the UNICORN app. You can explore the UNICORN app [here on Apple Store](https://apps.apple.com/no/app/unicorn-fargelegging-spill/id1293646758?l=nb).

# Usage
1. Start by cloning the GitHub repository to your local machine, and locate the `index.html` file in the cloned repository folder.
2. Once the application is open in your browser, you'll see a dropdown menu. Select available picture you wish to color.
3. The color palette contains various colors you need to use to fill in the picture. Click on a color to select it, and start coloring! 
4. Don't forget to click "Submit" button for a small celebration. 

# Current Features
-   **Single Coloring Picture.** Currently, the application features one coloring picture named "Rainbow".

# Future Plans
The goal is to expand the library of images available for coloring.
