# Color-by-Number

üçã A simple Color by Number application, developed with JavaScript. 

This project is inspired by a game I have in my phone called "UNICORN". 
The pictures' design are borrowed from the game. 
Here is the link to the UNICORN App: https://apps.apple.com/no/app/unicorn-fargelegging-spill/id1293646758?l=nb

At the moment there is only one picture avaiable to color. The picture is called "Rainbow".
